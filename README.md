# SIP Trunking in the Cloud Age of Telecommunications

We believe setting up business communications should be a straightforward, painless process. That’s why we build our SIP services to play well with whichever communications platform you might use – whether it’s hardware-based or hosted in the cloud; built internally or bought from a third-party vendor.

In effect, this enables you to Bring Your Own Carrier (us!) to any other communications platform you use. Why is this better than paying for a bundled service from one provider? Because it allows you to benefit from Voxbone’s fully compliant, reliable voice infrastructure, and the improved connectivity and scalability of our network, while continuing to use your existing apps. It’s a win-win for you.

This repository contains guides and technical files explaining the how you can unbundle your communications platform deployment by moving your PSTN connectivity to the cloud.
